# cert-manager

cert-manager is a Kubernetes add-on to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates.

## Features

- Automatic certificate provisioning and renewal
- Support for multiple issuers (Let's Encrypt, Vault, self-signed, etc.)
- Native Kubernetes integration via CRDs

## Sync Wave

This application uses sync-wave `-3` to ensure it's deployed after storage but before applications that need TLS certificates.

## Creating a ClusterIssuer

After cert-manager is deployed, create a ClusterIssuer for Let's Encrypt:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: your-email@example.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod-account-key
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: haproxy
```

For testing, use the staging server:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: your-email@example.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-staging-account-key
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: haproxy
```

## Using Certificates

Request a certificate for your ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: example-tls
  namespace: default
spec:
  secretName: example-tls-secret
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
    kind: ClusterIssuer
  dnsNames:
    - example.com
    - www.example.com
```

Or use annotations on your Ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - example.com
      secretName: example-tls-secret
  # ... rest of ingress spec
```
